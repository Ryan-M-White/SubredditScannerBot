Welcome to the Subreddit Scanner Bot for r/forhire!

This is my first bot and I'm very excited to have it up and running. The bot works by scanning r/forhire initially upon opening and then once every half hour.
During the scanning process, if a post title with the "[Hiring]" tag is found, a message will be sent to you with information such as: The post title, the post body, a template for replying to that post in a PM, and a link to the original URL of the post if you wish to visit it.

How to use:
The bot itself is fairly automated. The only thing that's required of the user right now is to go into the creds.txt file
and fill in some necessary information. Delete the items with braces (including the braces themselves) and replace them with the information listed inside the braces. 
Example:
replace {{RedditUsername}} with your username and no braces.

You don't need to worry about touching cache.txt. That file is only for storing the IDs of posts that have already been "seen" and notifications have been sent out for. Deleting anything from that file will cause duplicate notifications to be sent when the script is restarted.

State of the project:
For right now this bot only runs locally, however you are free to throw it up somewhere if you like to get around that.

I am looking into doing that myself and possibly allowing other people to send a message to the bot to "subscribe" to it's services. In the future it may also expand to other subreddits for job postings
if there is interest, and it could even have customizeable settings for each user. But for now this is all it does, and it gets the job done.
